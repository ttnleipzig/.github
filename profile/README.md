# TTN Leipzig

![Leipzig Panorama](./profile/panorama.png)

> IoT is our passion. We love to build things and connect them to the Internet. We are a community of people who are interested in the Internet of Things and want to build a network of connected devices in Leipzig. We are a part of the global LoRaWAN network, which is a low power wide area network (LPWAN) designed to wirelessly connect battery operated “things” to the Internet in a regional, national or global network.

## ⁉️ What is LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) designed to wirelessly connect battery operated “things” to the Internet in a regional, national or global network. It is an open standard developed by the LoRa Alliance, an open, non-profit association of members from leading companies in the wireless industry, with the goal of standardizing Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

## 🛜 What is TTN?

The Things Network is a global community building an open and decentralized data network for the Internet of Things. It is a global open-source LoRaWAN network operated by its community of volunteers. The network is built using LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol designed to allow low-powered devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections at low bit rates.
